Warm - To deploy a simple OpenStack environment from template
=============================================================

  This project doesn't claim to be a solution like heat, it just try to expose 
Api by the way of templates. It's a simple way to deploy small environments.

Please report me any bugs or features. I will be happy to work on.

How to use it:
==============

  - First to install it use pip (don't forget to check for dependances).
$ pip install warm
  
  - We are considering your env are already configured.
$ export | grep OS_
declare -x OS_AUTH_URL="https://identity/v2.0"
declare -x OS_PASSWORD="*******"
declare -x OS_TENANT_ID="ea262aa012f244f8af2d1687977aaa81"
declare -x OS_TENANT_NAME="my-project"
declare -x OS_USERNAME="sferdjaoui"

  - We are now ready to create our first template.
$ cat > my-tpl.yaml <<EOF
server:
- name: srv
  flavor: m1.small
  image: cirros-0.3.1-x86_64-uec # You may have to configure this option.
EOF

- We can now run warm.
$ warm my-tpl.yaml

To get more information about a template syntaxe, see config.yaml.sample.
